- Refactor to antd

Fix shapes
    - could create a new directory for shapes
    - could query shapes on demand: based on the trips involved and from the stops 
    - would make it easier to debug and reduce the payload probably
    - send the trip id if the shape
    - combined with the bus then
    - could then on the frontend make swrHook for it
Fix anything else on the backend - 1hr
    - error handling - done
    - logging - done
    - figuring out the direction for luas - done
Fix anything left on the database
